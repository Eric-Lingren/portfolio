This is my public-facing portfolio site deployed at ericlingren.com  It contains examples of my projects along with links to those live deployments.  

This site was built in Vanilla ES6, CSS HTML5 and uses my original Photoshop work.  Custom animations were built with GreenSock.

This site is fully responsive across all devices and platforms.  Animation effects will not work on IE.
